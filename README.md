<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Pokemon Logo](images/pokeLogo.png)](https://pokedex-dsc.herokuapp.com/)

While this project started as just a program requirement, we wanted to build something with substance. Why? Because we are developers of course! The application outlined in this documentation is a chat application designed to take you back to early 2000's AIM/ Yahoo messenger. While we hope the application is reminiscent of simpler times, We Would like to deliver something more than a simple application.

Current Features:

* Register - Create a login for access to the app.
* Login - authentication based login to the application
* Chat - send messages to other users connected to the session
 

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
* [Material-Ui](https://mui.com/getting-started/usage/)
* [Paypal](https://developer.paypal.com/)




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Getting started, you'll want to run the "npx create-react-app" command, once complete you will need pull the image files from the github repo and clean up the basic create react app files. we do not need logo.svg, app.tesst.js, and their associated calls in the index and app.js files. This program also does not make use of the index.css file but can be left at user digression. Once these are all cleaned up install the required node modules.

### Prerequisites

* Create React App
  ```sh
  npx create-react-app "appname"
  ```
* Axios
  ```sh
  npm install axios

* Material Ui Core
  ```sh
  npm install @material-ui/core

* Material Ui Icons
  ```sh
  npm install @material-ui/icons

* React-Router-Dom
  ```sh
  npm install react-router-dom
  

### Installation


1. Create React APP
   ```sh
   npx create-react-app
   ```
2. Remove Unecessary files
   ```sh
   npm install 
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install 
   ```
4. Copy necessary files from the repo
   ```git
   git clone https://github.com/DaniSmith03/PokedexDemo
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This code can be used as a base to build a pokedex or ecommerce store due to its design setup with extra code. Due to the framework the code it'self is a bit flexible however, the instructions outline building a pokedex app. 



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Planned future updates:

* Favorites- add pokemon you love to a list you can revisit as your favorites.
* Upgraded Details: Currently each pokemon card only displays a limited amount of details, in the future I would like to expand this to pull more information from the PokeAPI
* Build Teams- I would like to builda feature that allows users to select pokemon from the pokedex and stage them in a comparison view so the user can compare base stats and skills when building pokemon teams for the console game or card game.  


Known Bugs

* Site is not currently optimized for mobile devices.
